Repo for 2D Plotter
## Stepper_Basic : This code is used for testing the stepper motors and/or stepper drivers like A4988 and other drivers similar to A4988.
## Stepper_Motor : This code is used for rotating the stepper to the desired angle given as an input by the user via serial window of Arduino.
## grbl-servo-master : This code is the final code used for the motion of both manipulator and pen mechanism. Upload this code onto Arduino Uno and using any G-Code sender motion of stepper and servo can be achieved. To read further about G-Code senders refer https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender.
