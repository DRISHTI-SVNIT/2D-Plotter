# Stepper_Basic

This code is used for testing your stepper motor and stepper driver like A4988 and similar drivers using Arduino Uno controller.
On powering the circuit the stepper must rotate one full rotation anti-clockwise and then one full rotation clockwise.
For connections, follow the diagram on https://www.pololu.com/product/1182.
COnnect the STEP pin of the driver to Arduino pin 2 and DIR pin to Arduino pin 5.
